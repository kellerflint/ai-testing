Oh, look at the dust...\"', '\"Sena\": \"You\\'re coming with me!\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Damn it... So much for the town where new adventurers get their start. If this was a game, one of those clichÃ© resistance armies would come and rescue me... What the?\"', '\"Aqua\": \"Kazuma! Kazuma!\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Aqua? What are you doing here?!\"', '\"Aqua\": \"I came to save you, obviously! I\\'d never abandon a dear friend.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Why not defend me in the first place, then?\"', '\"Aqua\": \"Megumin just used her explosion magic on the outskirts of town.

Darkness should be running away with the depleted Megumin as we speak.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"But won\\'t I be making things worse by running?\"', '\"Aqua\": \"I hear you can be executed for subversive activities. You\\'re just an adventurer whose identity is suspect.

But how do I even get out of here?\"', '\"Aqua\": \"First, use that wire to pick the cell\\'s lock. After that, you can use your Stealth skill to escape the jail!

It\\'s a magical item that lets us see through lies. First off, where are you from, and what did you do before you became an adventurer?\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"They started off with a hard-to-answer question. I\\'m from Japan. I was a student there. Why\\'d it go off?!\"', '\"Sena\": \"Where are you from, and what did you do there?\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Hang on! I wasn\\'t really lying! I am from Japan. But I stayed home all day, every day, living a life of self-indulgence.\"', '\"Sena\": \"Why pretend to be a student?\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"I wasn\\'t really pretending... Oh, never mind. Damn it, I hate this thing!\"', '\"Sena\": \"I\\'ve never heard of a place called Japan before. So, what\\'s your motive for becoming an adventurer?\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"To save the people who were being oppressed by the Devil Kingâ€” I thought being an adventurer seemed cool, a fun way to make a lot of money, and a great way to make pretty girls fall all over me.\"', '\"Sena\": \"O-Okay. Well, next question. Did you have a grudge against the lord? I\\'ve heard that once you got into debt, you complained about him regularly.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"The reward I received for the dullahan hunt took care of the debts I owed for the town\\'s repairs. Even if we were trying to protect it, destroying the town in the process makes it a moot point. I understand that. That was actually the argument I used to convince my friends. I personally felt something like, \"This is how you treat the hero who saved this town?! You all should die!\"\"', '\"Sena\": \"I-I see. Moving on...\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Uh, can I ask you something? Can we just get to the point?

I apologize.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Oh, how nice. I guess the harsh treatment was just for criminals... Honestly, taking rumors at face value like that! Makes you a bad prosecutor, doesn\\'t it?\"', '\"Sena\": \"I-I\\'m sorry...\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Do you know what I\\'ve accomplished? I contributed the most to our subjugation of that dullahan! We beat the Destroyer thanks to the amazing job I did as commander! And instead of getting any thanks, I get accusations instead!\"', '\"Sena\": \"S-Sorry about that! It\\'s just that this is my job... And I do know of your accomplishments, Satou-san. But...\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"But? But what, exactly?! Also, even after I\\'m cleared of suspicion, you guys still don\\'t offer me any tea? I\\'d even take a pork cutlet bowl!\"', '\"Sena\": \"P-Pork cutlet...? I\\'m sorry, we don\\'t have anything like that... I can get you some tea right away, though!\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"It\\'s lukewarm! Don\\'t the prosecutors here even know how to serve tea?!\"', '\"Sena\": \"I-I\\'m sorry!\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"I bet this gap between that harsh attitude and how you are now means you don\\'t have a boyfriend, either. I may as well ask! Do you even have a man?\"', '\"Sena\": \"I do not. Yes, I realize that my personality is why I don\\'t have any male companionship, in spite of my age. Are you satisfied? Please don\\'t get too full of yourself.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"I\\'m sorry...\"', '\"Sena\": \"Do you know what you\\'re called around town?\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Huh?\"', '\"Sena\": \"\"Crapuma\" and \"Kazutrash\" and such.\"', '\"Kazuma Satou\": \"Th-That\\'s horrible!

What\\'re you basing it on?!\"', '\"Sena\": \"The basis for the case? Very well. First! Even if it was to defeat a dullahan, he damaged the town with a flood. Second!

Exercise your right to remain silent!\"', '\"Sena\": \"Covering your ears doesn\\'t mean that it didn\\'t happen!
